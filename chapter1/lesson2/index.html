    If you haven't already, open main.js in your favorite text editor that supports syntax highlighting.
    <br />
    Don't have one? Download <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>.
    <br />
    Sublime Text is slightly easier to navigate as a first time user, and has a standalone version. VSCode on the other hand is an all-around
    better editor if that's the kind of thing you want to invest some time in learning.

    <br />
    Make sure you also have the console open in this window.
    <br />
    To open the console:
    <ul>
      <li>Right click anywhere on this page</li>
      <li>Click "Inspect"</li>
      <li>Click the "Console" tab in the window that opened</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    Now read main.js from the top to start your lesson!
