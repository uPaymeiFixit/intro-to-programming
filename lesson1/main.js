/**
 * Welcome! I've had a few people ask me how to program lately, and felt like
 * this would be a decent way to start learning. I'd love to improve this as
 * much as possible, so if you have any feedback, or there was anything unclear,
 * please let me know. You can email me at josh@gibbs.tk or make an issue on
 * Github. My goal with this template will be to just provide the very basics of
 * programming. I'm not going to try to introduce any complex programming
 * paradigms or APIs or anything super language specific. We'll just cover the
 * very basics, and we'll do that by having you read and modify my own code.
 * There is no cheating. Your job as a programmer is to Google as much as
 * possible. Copy other people's code, tweak it here and there; in my opinion
 * that's the best way to learn. So lets get started then.
 *
 * The first thing we'll cover real quick is what this file is and how to test
 * your code. One of the benefits of JavaScript (the language we're using) is
 * that it can be run in the browser without you needing to install anything.
 * I've set up this template so that all you need to do to see your code run is
 * open the demo.html file in your browser, which you can usually do by double
 * clicking on it. The HTML (HyperText Markup Language) file often holds the
 * text, images, and overall formatting of a web page. In our case it holds a
 * simple grey "canvas" element, which we will draw on. It's a full web page
 * just like any other website you would visit, the only difference is we only
 * have one big element. The file you're in right now is the JavaScript file.
 * JavaScript is often responsible for more dynamic elements of a web page, like
 * submitting a form or interactive animations, which is what we're going to
 * focus on. Since I've set up the demo.html file to automatically link to this
 * JavaScript file, all you need to do to see your saved changes in this file is
 * reload the demo.html page in your browser. If you change a color from "green"
 * to "blue" in this file and save it, once you refresh the page in your browser
 * you should see the change reflected. And I would encourage you to mess with
 * as much as possible. Break it and fix it. Get familiar with the undo button.
 * Don't rely solely on this text to teach you; learn by doing.
 *
 * Since we're in a comment, lets talk about them first. Every line of this file
 * will be processed and executed by your computer from top to bottom (with a
 * few exceptions). Even this big block of text you've been reading gets
 * processed, but since it's surrounded by the slash and asterisks you see the
 * computer knows not to try to execute these lines. Comments are useful for a
 * ton of reasons, from helping you understand what a block of code does to
 * communicating to other developers such as yourself. There is no such thing as
 * "self-documenting" code, no matter how good it is...Louis.
 */

// You can start a comment with two slashes (//) too, which is more common

/**
 * Just as in math we might want define a variable like a = 10, we do the same
 * when programming like this:
 */
let a = 10;
/**
 * The `let` portion of this line, which is called the declaration, tells the
 * language interpreter (the browser runtime) that we will be declaring a
 * variable. It's also useful to know, even though we won't use them in this
 * file, that there are alternative declarations to `let` such as `const`.
 *
 * After the declaration we specify the variable name. I chose `a` to be my
 * variable name, but we could have chosen anything that doesn't contain spaces
 * or some symbols, or starts with a number. For example I could also define
 * the following variable:
 */
let Much_longer_variable_name1337 = 42;
/**
 * We set that variable name equal to (=) whatever value we want it to be. This
 * section could be very long, but in order to keep it short we'll briefly
 * mention that JavaScript lets us assign almost anything to a variable, not
 * just numbers, but we won't worry as much about that. For this we'll focus on
 * numbers and text (strings). I could set my name to a variable by surrounding
 * it with quotes like this:
 */
let user_name = "Josh Gibbs";
/**
 * The last thing you may have noticed is the semicolon at the end of the line.
 * This tells the JavaScript interpreter that it has reached the end of the
 * line. Not all languages (python) use semicolons to end a line, but most do.
 * Your JavaScript interpreter will likely be forgiving if you forget this, but
 * it's best to include it. JavaScript is very forgiving...
 */

/**
 * Now lets learn about logging. Sometimes its helpful to see what the output
 * of a function or the value of a variable is while the code is running. Here
 * are a few examples of how you can do this:
 */
console.log("This is a string.");
console.log(a);
console.log("The value of a =", a);
console.log("The answer was " + Much_longer_variable_name1337);
console.log("Hello,", user_name);
/**
 * You can see the output of all of these by right clicking on the web page in
 * the browser, clicking "Inspect", and then switching to the "Console" tab.
 * You should see the output in that window.
 */

/**
 * The next concept gets a little more complicated: functions. Just like in
 * math, functions take an input, process the data, and produce an output. I'll
 * show you an example of a function that simply doubles a number: x, and then
 * explain how it works:
 */

function f(x) {
  return x + x; // Yes, `2 * x` would have worked too
}
/**
 * We declare a function using the `function` keyword. There are other ways to
 * declare a function, and this isn't the same for every language, but it's
 * what we'll focus on for now. After the declaration we name our function. I
 * named it f, but you could have named it anything that follows the same rules
 * as naming a variable. After that we'll specify the parameters the function
 * accepts. Parameters are just like variables. Here, we chose `x` as the name
 * but we could have named it anything like a variable. Then we surround our
 * code in curly braces { } to tell the interpreter that all of the code in
 * between the curly braces belongs to that function. We also returned a value
 * in this function, we'll go over how this works in more detail later but in
 * short it allows us to get information out of the function, or another way to
 * think about it is assigning the function a dynamic value.
 *
 * We can call this function like this:
 */
f(4);
/**
 * We called it! It assigned the value we passed in, 4, to x and then returned
 * 4 + 4. Fascinating but useless, because we didn't do anything with that
 * data. Lets do it again, but this time lets assign it to a variable and then
 * print the value of that variable:
 */
let doubled_number = f(4);
console.log("The output of f(4) =", doubled_number);
/**
 * We should see 8 printed in the console now. We could have also called f(4)
 * inline with the same result like this:
 */
console.log("The output of f(4) =", f(4));
/**
 * Both of these are functionally the same.
 *
 *
 * Lets look at a much more complicated example, incorporating everything we've
 * learned so far. I feel like I've over-explained everything so far, so I'm
 * going to possibly under-explain here. This is where feedback would be useful
 * for me if it's confusing.
 */

// This function calculates BMI
function bmi(name, weight_in_pounds, partial_height_feet, partial_height_inches) {
  // The formula for BMI is weight (kg) / height^2 (m^2)
  // We need to convert pounds to kg first. 1lb = 0.453592kg
  let weight_in_kg = weight_in_pounds * 0.453592;

  // Now lets combine our height measurements into inches
  let height_in_inches = partial_height_feet * 12 + partial_height_inches;
  // Convert in to meters. 1in = 0.0254m

/**
 * Phew, that was a lot. Hopefully it all made sense. The only tricky thing we
 * did that might catch people of guard is we did not return a value. That's

/**
 * We'll move onto another topic: if statements! AKA poor man's artificial

/**
 * I hope you're not as tired of reading this as I am of writing it. We're gonna
 * cover for loops in as much detail as I can muster now.
 *
 * Often times we need to process lots of things. Maybe its fields in a PDF or
 * pixels in a picture, or enemies or bullets in a game. There are several types
 * of loops, and many ways to write a for loop, but we'll go over the classic
 * for loop which is largely the same in most languages. Here's an example of a
 * simple for loop:
 */

/**
 * There's a lot going on here, so lets do our best to break it down. A for loop
 * has three parts in its header. The first part can do whatever you like, or
 * nothing at all. In 99% of cases it will be used to define our iterator
 * variable. Most people, including me in this case, named the iterator i.
 * Some people will dock points off of your assignments if you use the
 * incredibly common `i` variable name; I'm looking at you, Professor James
 * Hester ;)
 * The second part of the for loop header is the conditional statement. This
 * is similar to the body of a for loop in that it takes a true or false
 * (boolean) statement. If the statement evaluates to true, the loop will
 * continue to run. In most cases this will be `i < N` where N is the number of
 * times the loop should run. Our loop above runs 10 times, from 0 to 9.
 * The last part of the loop header can also be used for anything you want, but
 * in most cases it's used to increment the iterator. We're adding 1 to i every
 * time the loop runs in our case.
 * As a result we're logging numbers 0 through 9 with the above loop.
 */

a++; // Increments `a` by 1. Equivalent to `a = a + 1`

/**
 * Lets take a quick break from for loops, because we're going to get more
